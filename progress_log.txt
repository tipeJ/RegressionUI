# Interim report 3 (14.4)
Added functionality:
 - Implementation for Linear regression via least squares method. Seems to be working as intented, but I will add tests before the final submission to further verify.
 - Implementation for quadratic regression via least squares method. Again, more tests required.
 - Working coordinates view, with modifiable regression color scheme and axis labels.
 - More menubar functionality, including button to change current regression fit, button to display the fit equation and a button to change the trendline color.

The application works as intended in the project plan file. More additional functionality may be added before the final submission date (I have some exams this week). Coordinates zoom-in feature might be added, although I don't think it's really necessary for the purpose of the program, and testing/other functionality will come first.

Encountered difficulties:
 - The least squares method for the linear regression was rather simple to implement based on the wikipedia source, but the quadratic counterpart was quite a bit harder. The reason why I changed the method from the intended LaGrange polynomials to the Least Squares one was that I found out that the former results in a trendline which goes through all of the data points, which would create a very complex polynomial and not the second degree one I wanted.
 - Some problems regarding the UI layout of the application, namely the scaling of the coordinate panel.
 - It turned out that the ScalaFX Linechart class was satisfactory to implement the coordinates panel (I initially planned to do a completely custom view), which speeded up the development significantly.

Workload: About 12-14 hours

Currently I'm ahead of the schedule I presented in the project plan, but I feel like there will be plenty of stuff to go through in the last two weeks.

# Interim report 2 (31.3)

Added functionality:
 - File loading and data parsing from .txt and .json formats (still work to be done here, especially in testing)
 - All placeholders (Except for the coordinates) replaced by actual UI components

The application can now be ran, and there will be a button for loading correctly formatted table data. An error message will be displayed if the file is incorrectly formatted or can't be opened. The currently opened sheets can be seen via the tab panel, and the current data set can be inspected via the data panel on the left, which will also display the axis labels. The menubar class has currently only the file loader button, but more features will be added later as needed for the coordinator UI part, which will be implemented next.

I encountered some difficulties splitting the UI to multiple explicit scala files instead of having everything in the main Application class, but I think that I managed to do reasonably well, while preserving the possibility of extending the project in the future. The main application UI structure is still somewhat unfinished, and not all functions there will be present in the final submission.

Workload: About 7 hours
I am currently closely following the schedule I had set in the Project Plan. Next up is implementing the coordinates view with the different regression displays.

I saw that you had added a note to my Project Plan where you said that I was aiming for the intermediate level, but I am currently targeting the advanced difficulty. Just hoped to clear that up :).

# Interim report 1 (17.3)

Added functionality:
 - Dataset, Sheet classes
 - Basic UI placeholder
 - Fileloader implementation, for both the standard file format and the JSON format (as described in the project plan)

The application can be ran, and Fileloader class has unit tests in the tests folder (DatasetLoaderTest) for both of the data formats. The simple placeholder UI works as can be expected.

No difficult errors have occurred. I noticed that you can't use integers as keys in JSON, so I had to slightly change the planned JSON format to accommodate this limitation.

Workload: About 10-12 hours.

I am roughly following the schedule I set for myself in the project plan, maybe slightly ahead as I hadn't planned to start the UI development part yet.
